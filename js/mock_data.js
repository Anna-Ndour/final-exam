        description: "The Mali Empire emerged in the 13th century in West Africa after the decline of the Ghana Empire. It was founded by Sundiata Keita, who united several Mandé kingdoms after defeating the Sosso ruler at the Battle of Kirina in 1235. This victory marked the beginning of a powerful and centralized state.\n\nMali grew wealthy by controlling the trans-Saharan trade, especially gold and salt, two of the most valuable commodities of the medieval world. The empire’s prosperity allowed it to expand over a vast territory and maintain political stability for centuries.\n\nThe empire reached its height during the reign of Mansa Musa (1312–1337). His famous pilgrimage to Mecca demonstrated Mali’s immense wealth and helped establish diplomatic and cultural ties with the wider Islamic world. During this period, cities like Timbuktu and Djenné became major centers of commerce, Islamic scholarship, and education, with institutions such as the University of Sankore.\n\nFrom the 15th century onward, Mali gradually declined due to internal conflicts, succession struggles, and the rise of rival powers like the Songhai Empire, which eventually replaced Mali as the dominant force in the region.",

        geography: "The Mali Empire was located in West Africa and covered parts of several modern countries, including Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Gambia, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Mauritania. Its territory stretched from the Atlantic coast to the edge of the Sahara Desert.The capital was Niani, located near the upper Niger River, which was the heart of the empire. The Niger River was essential for transportation, trade, and agriculture. The empire’s geography included savannas, river valleys, and desert regions. Agriculture was based on crops such as millet, sorghum, rice, and cotton, supported by fertile lands along the Niger. Livestock herding was also important.This diverse environment allowed the Mali Empire to become economically strong and to control major trade routes between North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.",

It began after Egyptian rulers expelled the Hyksos, foreign rulers who had controlled parts of Egypt.\n\nDuring this period, powerful pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, Seti I, and Ramesses II expanded Egypt’s territory through military campaigns and diplomacy. Egypt controlled Nubia to the south for its gold resources and parts of the Levant to the north, securing trade routes and political dominance.\n\nThe New Kingdom was also a time of great wealth, monumental architecture, and cultural achievement, including the construction of temples, tombs in the Valley of the Kings, and the spread of Egyptian religion and art.\n\nThe empire declined after 1200 BCE due to internal instability, economic difficulties, and invasions by foreign groups, leading to the end of the New Kingdom around 1069 BCE.",

        geography: "The Egyptian Empire was located in Northeast Africa, centered along the Nile River, which was the foundation of Egyptian life. The Nile provided fertile land through its annual floods, making agriculture possible in an otherwise desert environment.\nEgypt controlled territories from Nubia (modern Sudan) in the south to parts of the Levant in the north. Natural barriers such as the Sahara Desert, the Red Sea, and surrounding mountains helped protect the empire. Agriculture focused on crops like wheat, barley, flax, and papyrus, grown in the Nile Valley and Delta. The empire also benefited from access to the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea, which supported trade and communication with Africa, the Near East, and beyond. This geography made Egypt both well-protected and economically strong.",
