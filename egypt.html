          <h1>Ancient Egypt</h1>
          <p>
            The Egyptian Empire mainly refers to the New Kingdom period
            (c. 1570–1069 BCE), when Egypt reached its peak of power,
            wealth, and territorial expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this era, Egypt controlled lands from Nubia in the south
            to parts of the Levant in the north and became one of the most
            influential civilizations in the ancient world.

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
      Ancient Egypt was located in northeastern Africa and was centered around
      the Nile River. The river provided fertile land, water, and transportation,
      making agriculture and trade possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Natural barriers such as deserts and seas helped protect Egypt from invasions
      and contributed to its long-term stability.
